	Tron: Ares is the next chapter in the Tron franchise, following a powerful Program named Ares who is sent from the digital world of the Grid into the real world on a critical mission. As the first AI of his kind to enter human reality, Ares’s arrival sparks profound consequences, blurring the lines between artificial intelligence and humanity. The film explores the collision between digital and physical realms, raising questions about identity, technology, and the future of coexistence between humans and AI. Set after the events of Tron: Legacy, it introduces new characters while also bringing back familiar faces like Kevin Flynn, continuing the saga of digital evolution and rebellion.
